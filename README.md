Differential gene expression analysis done on the resistant and susceptible populations of poa annua

# Differential gene expression analysis pipeline 
Differential gene expression is a technique used to find the up- and down-regulated genes in their expression in an experimental design.
Here, we have 6 populations in which 3 are resistant and 3 are susceptible to the herbicide indaziflam.
